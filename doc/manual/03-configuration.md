# Configuration

## hrmp.conf

The configuration is loaded from either the path specified by the `-c` flag or `~/.hrmp/hrmp.conf`.

The configuration of `hrmp` is split into sections using the `[` and `]` characters.

The main section, called `[hrmp]`, is where you configure the overall properties
of `hrmp`.

Other sections doesn't have any requirements to their naming so you can give them
meaningful names like `[MySoundDevice]` for your main external DAC.

All properties are in the format `key = value`.

The characters `#` and `;` can be used for comments; must be the first character on the line.
The `Bool` data type supports the following values: `on`, `yes`, `1`, `true`, `off`, `no`, `0` and `false`.

Please note that `strict` and `minimal` are honored only on those systems that do not provide a native way to set the process title (e.g., Linux). On other systems, there is no difference between `strict` and `minimal` and the assumed behaviour is `minimal` even if `strict` is used. `never` and `verbose` are always honored, on every system. On Linux systems the process title is always trimmed to 255 characters, while on system that provide a natve way to set the process title it can be longer. |
