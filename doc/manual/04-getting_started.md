If you don't have **hrmp** in your path see [README](../README.md) on how to
compile and install **hrmp** in your system.

## Configuration

Lets create a simple configuration file called `hrmp.conf` with the content
generated by `hrmp -I` which will look like

```
[hrmp]

device=FIIO K19

log_type = file
log_level = info

[FIIO K19]
device=iec958:CARD=K19,DEV=0
description=USB Audio IEC958 (S/PDIF) Digital Audio Output
```

In our main section called `[hrmp]` we setup logging will be performed at `info` level and put in a file called `/tmp/hrmp.log`.
The default device will be "FIIO K19".

Next we create a section called `[FIIO K19]` which has the information about our
device with its device address.

We are now ready to run **hrmp**.

See [Configuration](./CONFIGURATION.md) for all configuration options.

## Running

We will run **hrmp** using the command

```
hrmp -c hrmp.conf <directory|files>
```

The default configuration of **hrmp** is loaded from `~/.hrmp/hrmp.conf`.
